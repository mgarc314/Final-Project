Welcome to the Cryptogram Game!

This game is both fun and gets your brain thinking! Let's go over the rules.

You will be provided with a stamen with some letters already provided and set in place within the statement.

Within the provided statement the letters already provided will have a corresponding number below them.

This correlation then designates a letter with a number, helping you clue the missing letters!

As you guess and get a letter correct, the corresponding number will appear below.


You will only be allowed three mistakes before being given a new statement to decipher.

Let's begin!
