This document will provide a guide to using the cryptogram game/simulation.
The materials that I will provide users to guide them through using this program is firstly an introduction page.
  - This introduction page will include clear inctsructions of the project/game. Explaining that this is a cryptogram game/simulation, where a piece of text is written in code and must be deciphered through numbers. Individuals will be given a statement with some letters already provided and set in place in the statement, with each of the letters having a number under them that corresponds to them. Players will need to fill in the rest of the letters through the already provided letters to reveal the statement. Players will only be allowed three mistakes, and once they use those mistakes they will be given a new statement that they must figure out.
  - On top of instructions this first page will include a start button that allows players to commence.
This will then lead to the simulation beginning.
